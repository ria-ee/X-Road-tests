# Introduction

This document holds the information and instructions for the X-ROAD automated tests. The document introduces the project architecture and describes packages and more important classes and methods.

Firstly, the document introduces technologies which were used in the creation of the project. It also describes the plugins, packages and libraries needed for executing the project was agreed upon.

Secondly, the architecture of the project is described. Specifically, packages, classes and methods are described in detail.

Finally Jenkins project configuration is brought out and how to execute the test. In similar manner it is possible to run other tests too.



# 1.Used Technologies
## 1.1 Programming languages

Automatic tests are created using Python (version 2.7)

## 1.2 Automation tools

Firefox browser version 47.0.2 and Selenium WebDriver 2.53.6 were used when tests were created.
It is also possible to use Firefox browser version 52.0 and Selenium WebDriver version 3.0.2 when executing tests.

Python library Nose2 will save the result in XML format, Jenkins plugin Junit plugin converts it to a html format.


# 2 Framework description

The main class in the test framework is **main.MainController**. This communicates with the browser, handles exceptions and provides configuration parameters to the tests using a **helpers.ConfReader** instance.


## 2.1 Framework structure

The framework consists of Python packages that contain classes, view models and helper files. Helper files contain functions used by different classes.

The framework also requires a mock service to be running and accessible from security servers. This is not part of the testing framework but as it is a required service, it is also described in this chapter.

The framework also requires an HTTP server that serves WSDL files (service descriptions) to the security server. This is not part of the testing framework but as it is a required service, the WSDL files are also described in this chapter.

## 2.2 List of framework packages (directories)

| temp | Temporary data created from tests |
| tests | Tests. |
| view\_models | Page or object related functions and constants. |
The list of packages and directories in the framework is shown in the following table.

_Table 1. List of framework packages._

| **Package** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| helpers | Other classes and helper functions. |
| main | Main framework controller classes. |
| mock | Certificates and queries for mocking services |

## 2.3 Helpers Package

This package holds different helper classes and methods for easier access to resources.

_Table 2. List of files in helpers package_

| **Filename** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| confreader.py | ConfReader class, described later. |
| mockrunner.py | MockRunner class, described later. |
| soaptestclient.py | SoapTestClient class, described later. |

| xroad.py | Helper functions for XRoad datatypes. |

## 2.4 ConfReader class (confreader.py)

ConfReader is a class for storing and reading parameters from different sources. It supports reading parameters from command-line arguments, INI files, JSON files and text files containing one key=value pair on each line (ignoring empty lines).

**Configuration parsing**

INI files, config files and command-line arguments are all parsed to detect types (Boolean, None, string, integer, float) automatically. Values are initially loaded as strings and type detection is necessary for some methods that need integers or floats as input. The values are automatically checked for text &quot;True&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;None&quot;, and numeric values. Because keeping a numeric value as string may sometimes be necessary, type detection can be avoided by wrapping the value inside single quotes (&#39;), example: age=&#39;14&#39;.

**Configuration examples setting the following values:**

| additional\_info=None (NoneType) --person.name=&quot;John Doe&quot; (string) --person.age=24 (integer) --person.tv\_show=&quot;24&quot; (string) --person.married=True (Boolean) |
| --- |

**Command-line arguments**

Each argument needs to be prefixed with two dashes (--). Long values should be wrapped inside double quotes (&quot;), values without spaces do not need to be wrapped.

Example assumes script filename of _test.py_

| python test.py --additional\_info=None --person.name=&quot;John Doe&quot; --person.age=24 --person.tv\_show=&quot;&#39;24&#39;&quot; --person.married=True |
| --- |

### 2.4.1 INI file (ini\_path)

INI files ignore empty lines and comment lines starting with a semicolon (;). ConfReader parameter names are constructed from section and key names, concatenated with a dot (.). Section [MAIN] (capital letters) is a special section that will not be used as a prefix.

Sections can be used for grouping parameters, but everything can be written under MAIN.

If command-line arguments are parsed (_init\_command\_line=True_ when initializing the class), INI file can be specified with argument **--ini=/path/to/file.ini**.

| ; Grouped parameters[MAIN]additional\_info=None[person]name=John Doeage=24tv\_show=&#39;24&#39;married=True | ; Everything grouped under MAIN [MAIN]additional\_info=Noneperson.name=John Doeperson.age=24person.tv\_show=&#39;24&#39;person.married=True |
| --- | --- |

### 2.4.2 Text file (config\_file)

Each line consists of key=value pair. Empty lines are ignored. Lines without an equals sign (=) are ignored and can be used as comments.

If command-line arguments are parsed (_init\_command\_line=True_ when initializing the class), configuration file can be specified with argument **--config=/path/to/file**.

| This is an example config file additional\_info=Noneperson.name=John Doeperson.age=24person.tv\_show=&#39;24&#39;person.married=True |
| --- |

### 2.4.3 JSON file

The advantage of using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is that values are converted to dictionaries without parsing them.

| {&quot;additional\_info&quot;: &quot;None&quot;, &quot;person.name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;, &quot;person.age&quot;: 24, &quot;person.tv\_show&quot;: &quot;24&quot;, &quot;person.married&quot;: true} |
| --- |

If command-line arguments are parsed (_init\_command\_line=True_ when initializing the class), JSON file can be specified with argument **--json=/path/to/file**.

_Table 3. ConfReader class methods_

| Method name | Method description |
| --- | --- |
| clear\_config() | Clear all parameters. |
| set\_config(conf) | Update parameters with dictionary _conf_, overwriting the existing values but not clearing everything. |
| set(key, value) | Set parameter _key_ value to _value_ |
| get(key) | Get parameter _key_ value. |
| get\_string(key, default=&#39;&#39;) | Get parameter _key_ value. If _key_ does not exist, return default value. |
| get\_int(key, default=0) | Get parameter _key_ integer value. If _key_ does not exist or is not an integer, return default value. |
| get\_floatkey, default=0.0) | Get parameter _key_ float value. If _key_ does not exist or is not a float, return default value. |
| get\_bool(key, default=False) | Get parameter _key_ Boolean value. If _key_ does not exist or is not a Boolean, return default value. |
| read\_command\_line\_arguments() | Reads parameters from command-line arguments. |
| read\_ini(ini\_file) | Reads parameters from an INI file. |
| read\_key\_value\_pairs(file) | Reads parameters from a configuration text file (key=value pairs). |
| read\_json(file) | Reads parameters from a JSON file. |

## 2.5 MockRunner class (mockrunner.py)

MockRunner is a simple class that controls the mock service script (SoapUI MockRunner) over an SSH connection.

Uses ssh\_helper.SSHClient component. Connects to SSH server, sends a one-liner command and then waits until a specified regex matches output or a timeout occurs. To stop the service, sends a single keycode (Ctrl-C by default).

### 2.5.1 Starting the service

When MockRunner tries to start the service, it goes through the following steps.

1. Connect to service server over SSH
2. Send username and password
3. Execute _command_
4. Check standard output (stdout) on the server and look for _ready\_regex_ match.
5. If match is found, service has been started. If timeout occurs first, service start failed.
6. Control is given back to the calling program.

If any of these steps fail, the service will not be started, start command returns False and MockRunner.error variable will contain an error message.

### 2.5.2 Stopping the service

Stopping the service is done by sending _stop\_keycode_ to standard input (stdin) over the SSH link. No other checks are made.

_Table 4. MockRunner class methods_

| **Method name** | **Method description** |
| --- | --- |
| start() | Start the service. Returns True if service start was detected, False otherwise. |
| stop() | Stop the service by sending _stop\_keycode_ key. |
| restart() | Restart the service by executing stop() and start() in sequence. |
| get\_error() | Returns last start() error or None if no error. |



## 2.6 SoapTestClient class (soaptestclient.py)

SoapTestClient is the test client class for sending SOAP requests to XRoad security servers. The component is used for testing if the services respond, succeed, return an error, and if the return data matches the expected data.

SoapTestClient uses the Python Requests library to send SOAP queries over HTTP(S) and parses response XML to extract XRoad service parameters.

_Table 5. SoapTestClient class methods_

| **Method name** | **Method description** |
| --- | --- |
| query(url=None, body=None, params=None, timeout=None) | Sends a query to the service.  _url_ and _body_ are required parameters. All parameters are optional when calling the method. If not set, they are replaced with default ones that were supplied to the init method. |
| check\_query\_success(url=None, body=None, params=None, query\_timeout=None, faults=None) | Checks if a query succeeds. Sends a query to the service using query() with the same parameters and check if a the response contains a Fault element and if the fault code matches a supplied list of faults. All parameters are optional when calling the method. If not set, they are replaced with default ones that were supplied to the init method. |
| check\_query\_loop(url=None, body=None, params=None, query\_timeout=None, faults=None, fail\_timeout=None, retry\_interval=None, verify\_service=None, check\_success=True) | Checks if a query succeeds or fails (depending on _check\_success_ value) before _query\_timeout_ occurs. Sends a query to the service using check\_query\_success() every _retry\_interval_ seconds until it returns the same value as _check\_success_. If _verify\_service_ is supplied, it then checks if it is a subset of response service parameters. Returns _True_ if all conditions are _True_ before _fail\_timeout_ seconds pass, _False_ otherwise. All parameters are optional when calling the method. If not set, they are replaced with default ones that were supplied to the init method. |
| check\_success(url=None, body=None, params=None, query\_timeout=None, faults=None, fail\_timeout=None, retry\_interval=None, verify\_service=None) | Checks if the query succeeds before _query\_timeout_ occurs. Sends a query to the service using check\_query\_loop() using _check\_success=True_ every _retry\_interval_ seconds until it returns _True_. If a timeout of _query\_timeout_ seconds occurs returns _False_. All parameters are optional when calling the method. If not set, they are replaced with default ones that were supplied to the init method. |
| check\_fail(url=None, body=None, params=None, query\_timeout=None, faults=None, fail\_timeout=None, retry\_interval=None, verify\_service=None) | Checks if a query fails before _query\_timeout_ occurs. Sends a query to the service using check\_query\_loop() using _check\_success=False_ every _retry\_interval_ seconds until it returns _True_. If a timeout of _query\_timeout_ seconds occurs returns _False_. All parameters are optional when calling the method. If not set, they are replaced with default ones that were supplied to the init method. |
| get\_service() | Internal method to extract service parameters as a dictionary from latest query response XML. |
| verify\_service(service) | Method to check if _service_ is a subset of last service parameters returned by _get\_service()_ |
| log(str) | Internal default debug logging method. Prints a string to standard output. |

## 2.7 SSHClient class (ssh\_client.py)

SSHClient is a simple SSH Client class using the Paramiko library. It connects to an SSH server and allows to execute commands, use standard input, output and receive errors (stdin, stdout, stderr). Connection is made during class initialization and remains open until _close()_ method is called.

_Table 6. SSHClient class methods_

| **Method name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| get\_client() | Returns the Paramiko internal SSHClient instance. |
| exit\_status() | Returns the last command&#39;s exit status code. |
| write(str, flush=False) | Writes to remote standard input (stdin). If _flush=True_, flushes the buffer after writing. |
| write\_flush(str) | Writes to remote standard input (stdin) and flushes the buffer. |
| writeline(line) | Writes a line to remote server, automatically adds a linefeed character. |
| readline() | Reads a line from remote standard output (stdout) and returns it without linefeed characters. |
| exec\_command(command, sudo=False, timeout=None) | Executes a command on the remote server. If _sudo=True_, tries to execute the command with _sudo_ prefix (root rights, user must have _sudo_ access). If _timeout_ in seconds is supplied, sets the Paramiko internal channel timeout. |
| open(host, username, password) | Connects to host over SSH using specified credentials. |
| close() | Closes the connection. |

## 2.8 AuditChecker class (auditchecker.py)

AuditChcker is an X-Road log (audit.log) checker. It connects to security or central server over SSH and gets the last audit.log rows from
it, then compares them to specified log entries and checks if they match. Used for checking if certain log entries have been added in some tests.

_Table 7. AuditChecker class methods_

| **Method name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| get\_regex() | Returns the compiled regular expression object created from internal regex string. |
| get\_line\_count() | Returns the current logfile line count using "wc -l" command. |
| get\_log\_lines(lines=None, from_line=None) | Gets a specified number of lines from the end of the logfile. If from_line is specified, gets all lines from this to the end of the file. |
| reorder\_lines(reverse_match) | Reverses the internal lists if reverse_match=True, used internally. |
| check_log(check, lines=None, from_line=None, reverse_match=True, skip_invalid_lines=True, strict=True) | Checks if log contains an entry or entries. |

## 2.9 Main Package

Main package contains two classes: MainController and AssertHelper.

**AssertHelper** is a base class for MainController adding assertion methods that can be used during tests.

**MainController** class is the test framework main controller. It handles and interacts with the web browser, provides helper functions for finding elements, logging in and out of XRoad, basic logging and main configuration parameters.
By default, MainController loads its configuration from _config.ini_ file located in the Main Package directory. If parameter _config.load\_custom\_config_ is set to _True_ (default), it also tries to load additional configuration parameters
from _config.kvp_ (key-value pairs), _config.ini_ (INI file), and _config.json_ (JSON) files in the current working directory (usually test directory).

## 2.10 Mock Directory

Mock directory (mock) contains the certificates and XML query bodies that are used by SoapTestClient mock client. It contains two subdirectories.

The &quot;cert&quot; subdirectory contains the certificate (mock.crt) and private key (mock.key) of the mock client, and the certificate of the Mock Service (mockservice.crt, used for verifying the server&#39;s certificate).

The &quot;queries&quot; subdirectory contains query templates that are parsed by SoapTestClient and sent by the server when testing access lists and services themselves. The list of query templates is shown in the following table.


_Table 9. Mock directory files_

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| service.xml | SOAP query template for sending queries to security server services. |
| centralservice.xml | SOAP query template for sending queries to central services. |

This directory holds temporary data and test failures(text files and screenshots) created by tests.

There is also a sub-directory &quot;download&quot; where downloaded files are stored, eg. certificates and signing requests.

## 2.12 Tests package

This package contains all the tests. Tests have their own packages.The test structure contains mostly three major files: \_\_init\_\_.py, test\_main.py and the test itself(usually in format test\_\*.py)



_Table 11. Test example architecture_

| \_\_init\_\_.py | Must be file for python package. Makes the test visible to others |
| --- | --- |
| test\_main.py | Extends unittest.TestCase class, calls the test with needed data. |
| test\_\*.py | Test itself, takes care of methods and calls needed for the test.. |

## 2.14 Mock Service

The UI testing  service (located under _mock/service-soapui_ directory) serves SOAP requests from users proxied by the security servers. It is a small service that is based on the main xrd-mock-soapui mock service but implements a lesser set of functionality and contains different services (_xroadGetRandom_ and _bodyMassIndex_). It is used for testing service parameters and access lists.

The UI testing mock service has been made in SoapUI and requires SoapUI to run. The mock service is not directly a part of the framework as it can be configured to be running all the time in a different server or the framework may be configured to use other (or non-SoapUI) services that may already be running.

It differs from the _xrd-mock-soapui_ service by defining different services and lesser functionality. As it is only used for verification of the main aspects of X-Road services, it is better and more easily maintainable to use a smaller service that only contains the necessary functionality than to merge it with others.

The UI testing mock service location is set in the WSDL files (under _&lt;wsdl:service&gt;_ subelement _&lt;soap:address&gt;_ attribute _location_) and framework configuration parameters _services.test\_service\_url_, _services.test\_service\_2\_url_, _services.test\_service\_url\_ssl_ (HTTPS), _services.test\_service\_2\_url\_ssl_ (HTTPS). The service must listen on two ports, one using regular HTTP protocol and the other using HTTPS.

| Examples of the part of a WSDL file that points to two services that should already be running on localhost port 8086 under different URLs.     &lt;wsdl:service name=&quot;xroadGetRandom&quot;&gt;        &lt;wsdl:port name=&quot;xroadGetRandomPortSoap11&quot;                binding=&quot;tns:xroadGetRandomPortSoap11&quot;&gt;            &lt;soap:address location=&quot;http://localhost:8086/xroadGetRandom&quot; /&gt;        &lt;/wsdl:port&gt;    &lt;/wsdl:service&gt;     &lt;wsdl:service name=&quot;bodyMassIndex&quot;&gt;        &lt;wsdl:port name=&quot;bodyMassIndexPortSoap11&quot;                binding=&quot;tns:bodyMassIndexPortSoap11&quot;&gt;            &lt;soap:address location=&quot;http://localhost:8086/bodyMassIndex&quot; /&gt;        &lt;/wsdl:port&gt;    &lt;/wsdl:service&gt; |
| --- |

The Mock Service itself is defined in a single XML file (SoapUI project) but as it has to support certificates, it also requires a SoapUI settings file (for supporting SSL), a key store and a certificate file. The list of files required to run the service is in the following table.

_Table 13. Mock service directory files_

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| soapui-settings.xml | SoapUI settings file (XML). Defines SSL port for services to be 18086, keystore file as &quot;mockservice.keystore&quot; and keystore password as &quot;password&quot;. These values can be edited in SoapUI or directly in XML under elements _&lt;con:setting&gt;_ with attributes &quot;id&quot; starting with &quot;SSLSettings&quot;. |
| testservice-soapui-project.xml | Mock service SoapUI project (XML). Defines two services: _xroadGetRandom_ and _bodyMassIndex_, both are run from port 8086 (if SoapUI settings define an SSL port, they are run from the SSL port at the same time as well). Can be edited from SoapUI. |
| mockservice.keystore | Keystore for the mock service. Default keystore password used is &quot;password&quot;. |

## 2.15 WSDL files

The WSDL files are used for providing information about services to the security servers. They describe the service (name and version) and the URL from which the security server can access it. Multiple services can be described in one WSDL.

The test automation scenarios require different WSDL files to test different outcomes - a working WSDL, a WSDL that removes a previously defined service, a WSDL that gives a parser error and a WSDL that gives a parser warning.

The WSDL files have to be served from an HTTP server that is accessible from security servers and accessible over SSH from the test framework (to edit the files remotely). WSDL files base URL is defined in the main configuration with key _wsdl.remote\_path_ and other WSDL parameters are also under _wsdl_ section.

List of WSDL files defined in the default configuration is in the following table.



_Table 14. WSDL files in default configuration_

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| testservice.wsdl | The WSDL that is added to the security servers. As the tests require the same file to be overwritten with others (working, erroneous, warning, removed service), it contains different data at different times. |
| testservice\_original.wsdl | This is the base WSDL file that is working correctly and defines two services: _bodyMassIndex.v1_ and _xroadGetRandom.v1_ |
| testservice\_xroadGetRandom\_only.wsdl | Derived from &quot;testservice\_original.wsdl&quot; but defines only one service: _xroadGetRandom.v1_ |
| error.wsdl | A file that results in a WSDL parser error. |
| warning.wsdl | A file that results in a WSDL parser warning. |

4. Add post build action
  * Publish Junit test result report
  * Add the file name which was previously copied.


## 3.2 Starting the project

Open project or from the projects list open project dropdown and click &quot;Build now&quot;. It is also possible to add build triggers.

## 3.3 Test results

When the test is done, you can see test result in Jenkins. Choose the test which result is wanted. Click on &quot;Latest Test Result&quot;.

The Junit report contains three sections: Result bar, All Failed Tests, and All Tests.


Result bar, show the percentage of failed, skipped and passed test on a line:

 Red - failed tests

 Yelllow - skipped tests

 Blue - passed tests

All Failed Tests table: shows the list of all failed tests.

All Tests table: shows the list of all tests, if test contains multiple tests, one can see them when clicking on the test link.


# 4 Performance testing
## 4.1 Programming languages

Performance tests are created using Scala programming language. They are located at [xrd-gatling-tests](../xrd-gatling-tests) directory.

## 4.2 Automation tools

Performance test is developed to work with Gatling 2.2.3 version.

## 4.3 Build management

Used libraries and other needed software are meant to be installed according to the manual or according to the documentation of the library.

### 4.3.1 Used Packages

* Jenkins
* Gatling

### 4.3.2 Used Plugins

* Junit Plugin

## 4.4 Mock

Mock sends out the messages with the size what Gatling script says. Sends them against the xtee9.ci.kit where is the WSDL registered.

Mock service will be started at the Jenkins job. Mock service runs cd /opt/riajenk/xrd-soapui-mock

../SoapUI-5.3.0/bin/mockservicerunner.sh

## 4.5 Installing performance test

Performance test file &quot;xroad.scala&quot; should be placed in the gatling/user-files/simulations folder.

Before running the tests, the performance test service [gatling.wsdl](../xrd-gatling-tests/gatling.wsdl) should be configured in the X-Road environment.

## 4.6 Command line parameters

Table will show command line parameters how you can modify the performance test. Variable should be used on the command line as -Dvariable=value.

Gatling performance test is not sending out messages in different size, it will send &quot;desiredResponseSize&quot; parameter, what indicates to mock service on which size should the response be. If users change the percentage of the sizes it is important to control that all size percentages summ will be 100.

## 4.7 Request validation
reqiests are validated against:
* HTTP response is 200
* Response ID code (<xrd:id>) is same as in request
* <SOAP-ENV:Fault> element is not presented
* Mock timestamp is in numbers and in <mockTimeStamp> element

### Post-build Actions
add Publish HTML reports stepp

HTML directory to archive : User needs to add  directory location where the report inex.exe and other files are (example: /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/XRoad-load-test/common/xrd-automated-tests/gatling_scripts/results/report)
Index page[s] : user should add html file names from report folders, they would like to see in result view tabs.(example: index.html )

## 4.9 Running performance test

### Preconditions to run test
* Service provider subsystem should have the service configured (gatling.wsdl added under the services).
* Service mock.v1 should have acces rights granted to the subsystem that is sending the queries.
* Service mock.v1 should be enabled.
* Mock service should be running 
	* Example command: cd /opt/riajenk/xrd-testing-service; ../SoapUI-5.3.0/bin/mockservicerunner.sh -s soapui-settings-gatling.xml gatling-mock.xml

If all the preconditions are fullfilled then you can start the jenkins buld and wait for the results.

Results are shown in the Jenkins Job behind the "report" link.
