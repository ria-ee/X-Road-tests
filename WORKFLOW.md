X-Road Tests development
# Workflow Policy

v1.0

## 1	General

1.1	This document establishes workflow policy for joint development of X-Road software. Workflow Policy strives to serve as a handbook for all practical aspects of development.

1.2	Workflow is understood as systematic arrangement of work, a complex of processes, practices, roles and responsibilities, communication patterns, and artefacts.

1.3	Goals of the workflow policy are to
- establish productive and secure collaborative open source working environment
- assure production of high quality software
- avoid duplication of effort, facilitate re-use of software
- transparency and openness
- broader community of developers
- use of software development best practice
- clear communication among Partners as well as other stakeholders in the X-Road development process
- innovation.

1.4 Adherence to this policy are made legally binding to Vendors by inclusion of appropriate stipulations in contracts between Partners and Vendors. Vendor in context of this policy is a firm or other organisation performing development work by assigment of a Partner.

1.5 Partners and Developers implement this policy in good faith and in the context of sustainable, good software development practice.

1.6 Projects may have their own workflow arrangements as far as these do not contradict this policy.

## 3 Development model

3.1	X-Road tests uses [Github](https://github.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) based version management.

## 4	Repositories

4.1	The following code and documentation repositories are used:
- Master Test Repository - short name: X-Road-tests; hosted by: GitHub; managed by: RIA; purpose: release of X-Road automated tests; access: Head Architect has write access; read access: ALL.
	- https://github.com/ria-ee/X-Road-tests

- Finland and Estonia develop in fork of ria-ee/X-Road-tests
	- Finland fork
		- https://github.com/vrk-kpa/X-Road-tests
	- Estonia fork
		- https://github.com/asaquality/X-Road-tests

4.2	Partners can establish their own, additional repositories, for backup, software distribution or other purposes.

## 5	Branching pattern

5.1	Branching pattern follows the [Gitflow model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). Two perpetual branches â€“ `master` , `develop` and own `testfeature` branches.

- `master` branch is used to release X-Road tests
- `develop` branch is used to test development
- `feature` branches are used to work on test features

Main repository:
- `master` branch https://github.com/ria-ee/X-Road-tests
	- Tagged releases of Xroad-tests
- `develop` branch https://github.com/ria-ee/X-Road-tests
	- Integration branch between Finland and Estonia
	- Latest integrated test development source code 
	- Make pull request to master for tagging release or milestone

Fork repository:
- `master` branch https://github.com/vrk-kpa/X-Road-tests and https://github.com/asaquality/X-Road-tests
	- Tagged releases of Xroad-tests
- `develop` branch https://github.com/vrk-kpa/X-Road-tests and https://github.com/asaquality/X-Road-tests 
	- Country branch for test development
	- Latest country test development source code 
	- Make pull request to develop for ria-ee/X-Road-tests

## 6 Tagging

6.1 The versions merged to X-Road-tests/master branch are tagged by Finnish / Estonian responsible persons.

git tag -a 6.16.0 -m "X-Road-tests for Xroad version 6.16.0"
